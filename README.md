# Transfer Learning, Quantization, and Robustness Testing on RDNetTiny

This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate key stages of deep learning model optimization and evaluation using the RDNetTiny architecture from Hugging Face, pretrained on ImageNet-1k, and fine-tuned on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## üìÅ Notebooks Overview

### 1. [`pretrainingrdnet.ipynb`](pretrainingrdnet.ipynb)
This notebook performs **transfer learning** by fine-tuning the pretrained RDNetTiny model from Hugging Face on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It includes:
- Dataset preparation and augmentation
- Model loading and customization for CIFAR-10
- Training with learning rate scheduling and performance monitoring
- Evaluation of the fine-tuned model

### 2. [`RDNetQuantization.ipynb`](RDNetQuantization.ipynb)
This notebook applies **post-training quantization** techniques to the transfer learned RDNetTiny model to reduce model size and improve inference speed. It includes:
- Dynamic and static quantization methods using Onnxruntime
- Accuracy evaluation and size/speed comparison with the original model

### 3. [`RDNetGaussianTesting.ipynb`](RDNetGaussianTesting.ipynb)
This notebook evaluates the **robustness** of the RDNetTiny model under common adversarial attacks. It includes:
- FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method) and PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) attacks
- Visualization of perturbed examples
- Accuracy degradation analysis under adversarial conditions

### 4. [`RDNetRobustness.ipynb`](RDNetRobustness.ipynb)
This notebook evaluates the **robustness** of the RDNetTiny model under sophisticated adversarial attacks. It includes:
- FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method)
- Linf Projected Gradient Descent Attack
- L2DeepFoolAttack
- L2 Projected Gradient Descent Attack
- Evaluating the the peturbation applied to dataset.
- Heatmaps for visualizing the peturbation applied to specific images and their pixel intensities.
